# Germline panel

The UMCCR germline panel is currently composed only of entries from the PMCC FCC panel with no modifications applied by
the curation team. While there is only one source list, the panel creation process is structured similarly to the
somatic panel so that additional sources may be added in the future.

## Procedure

1. Review literature, community for new sources
  * Include new sources in `1_panel_sources/` if appropriate with feedback from curation team
2. Apply any upstream changes for sources in `1_panel_sources/`
3. Construct final panel in `2_final_panel/`
4. Generate panel data files in `3_panel_data/`
